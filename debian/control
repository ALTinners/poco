Description: C++ Portable Components (POCO) Development files
 The POCO C++ Libraries are a collection of open source C++ class libraries
 that simplify and accelerate the development of network-centric, portable
 applications in C++. The libraries integrate perfectly with the C++ Standard
 Library and fill many of the functional gaps left open by it.
 .
 POCO is built strictly using standard ANSI/ISO C++, including the standard
 library. The contributors attempt to find a good balance between using advanced
 C++ features and keeping the classes comprehensible and the code clean,
 consistent and easy to maintain.
 .
 POCO consists of four core libraries, and a number of add-on libraries. The
 core libraries are Foundation, XML, Util and Net. Two of the add-on libraries
 are NetSSL, providing SSL support for the network classes in the Net library,
 and Data, a library for uniformly accessing different SQL databases.
